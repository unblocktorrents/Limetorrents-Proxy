# About Limetorrents
If you use a LimeTorrents proxy, you will find that this site works a little differently than your average torrent tracker. LimeTorrents is not a file repository, but a directory of files. The website does not act as a database for torrent trackers, but rather as a search engine that directs users to other hosting websites. The benefit is that it gives users a much wider range of files to browse, which at any given point in time have exceeded 50 million different torrent files.

When you're having trouble finding a specific file, LimeTorrents can be key to getting the torrent you're looking for.
